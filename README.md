# sqlalchemy-challenge

Given climate data I used Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration. I used SQLAlchemy ORM to make querys and organized the fidingins into plots to display the data. 
Additionally I designed a Flask API to display query data with several routes. The data can be used dynamically to get results from the given tables even if they are updated in the future.
